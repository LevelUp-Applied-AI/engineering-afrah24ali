## How to run

Follow these steps to set up the environment, run the code, and verify it works:

1. **Set up the environment**  
   - Activate your virtual environment:
     - Windows: `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
     - Mac/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-prework.txt`

2. **Run the code**  
   - From the root of the project, run:  
     `python scripts/sanity.py`

3. **Confirm success**  
   - Check the output to ensure it prints:
     - Python version
     - Platform information
     - Current working directory
     - Installed packages from requirements
   - If all these are displayed correctly, the script works.

# AI.SPIRE Pre-Work — Phase 3: Engineering Practices

**GitHub Classroom Phase 3 repo.** Days 6–9.

Phase 3 covers PR hygiene, pytest, SQL, and Docker — the engineering practices that make code reviewable, testable, and deployable.

## Phase overview

| Day | PR | Topic |
|-----|----|-------|
| 6 | PR 5 | PR Hygiene: Template + Self-Review Checklist |
| 7 | PR 6 | First Tests: Make 5 Failing Tests Pass |
| 8 | PR 7 | SQLite Queries |
| 9 | PR 8 | Docker + Postgres Container Validation |

## Setup

Your venv and all packages from `requirements-prework.txt` should already be installed from Day 3. If you need to reinstall:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
# or: source .venv/Scripts/activate  (Windows Git Bash)
pip install -r requirements-prework.txt
```
